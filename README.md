# java-gui-project

 This is an implementation of a simple multi-layered architecture project in java.
 It is meant to be used as a means for a car rental company to track their available models, as well as past and future rentals.
 It has a user interface built with the JavaFX framework, and a couple of simple filtering operations using streams and functional programming.
